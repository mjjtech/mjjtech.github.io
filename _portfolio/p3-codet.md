## Overview
The **Computing Online Database of Educational Technologies** (**CODET**, pronounced _“code-it”_) is a repository of information for teachers seeking programmable learning technologies and curriculum to integrate into their practice.
It is currently being developed as a practical tool that will help teachers with applying the [PLT Framework](/portfolio/1-plt-framework) to their decision-making and help with widespread dissemination of PLT information.

CODET includes entries on PLT features, classroom applications, curriculum activity examples with alignment to CS standards, and connections to resources.
The PLT Framework serves as the backbone of what information is available in the database---i.e., CODET provides all the information a teacher would need to complete an evaluation led by the framework.
CODET is being co-designed with undergraduate students and teachers, soliciting their feedback in its design, features, and usability.
I am currently leading a design team of students in creating mockups for CODET based on teacher feedback and populating the database with PLT information.
We expect to have a prototype by early 2026, followed by increasing amounts of widespread testing with local and state teachers and through partnerships with schools and universities around the country.
