# Hello!

I am a postdoctoral research associate with the [CS Everyone Center for Computer Science Education](https://cseveryonecenter.org/) at the University of Florida.

I study how educational technology features and resources affect K--12 student learning outcomes in computing. I seek to understand why, when, and how we use these tools for computing education and how to translate that information into practical knowledge for teachers, students, and developers.

I earned my PhD in the [School of Interactive Computing](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was a member of the [Culture and Technology (CAT) Lab](https://betsydisalvo.com/).
